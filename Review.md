The article has been revised substantially and I appreciate the effort made by the authors. My main comments are on Algorithm 1 and its discussion:
- line 16: if B_sat is a list a buckets then this line should "foreach B in B_sat do\n foreach addr in B.addr do". Am I wrong?
- if extraCond is built using curExtraCond and curExtraCond is built using C_new and C_new is something like "e_addr = addr" then I don't understand why you say that "extraCond = {buf[0] = 'D'}"? "buf[0] = 'D'" seems not be something like "e_addr = addr". What am I missing?
- The discussion of Algorithm 1 has been significantly improved but it still needs some work.
