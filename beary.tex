\begin{abstract}
Coverage-based fuzz testing and dynamic symbolic execution are both popular program testing techniques. However, on their own, both techniques suffer from scalability problems when considering the complexity of modern software. Hybrid testing methods attempt to mitigate these problems by leveraging dynamic symbolic execution to assist fuzz testing. Unfortunately, the efficiency of such methods are still limit by some specific program structures and the schedule of seed files.

In this paper, we introduced a novel lazily symbolic pointer concretization method and a symbolic loop bucket optimization to ease the state explosion raised by dynamic symbolic execution in hybrid testing.
We also proposed a distance based seed selection method to rearrange the seed queue of the fuzzer to achieve higher coverage. We implemented a prototype and evaluated it from two viewpoints: vulnerability and path discovery. 
The vulnerability discovery results on three different benchmarks (
a demo program, the LAVA benchmark, and a set of real-world programs) show that our prototype can trigger more crashes than other off-the-shelf vulnerability detection tools in all of these benchmarks. Additionally, the path discovery evaluation result on several real-world programs show that our method can discover 43.49\% more unique paths than vanilla fuzz testing.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we focused on improving the performance of hybrid testing method built on coverage based fuzz testing and dynamic symbolic execution. We proposed a novel method, lazily concretization, to deal with symbolic pointers. We found that this method can postpone the ``state explosion'' problem and also improve code coverage. We also made an optimization based on loop bucket to avoid generating too many states in symbolic loops. To deal with the large size of seed queue in hybrid testing, we present a distance based seed selection method to achieve more coverage when testing time is limited. This criteria of selection method is built on top of runtime information (i.e, path and memory information). We implemented a prototype and the evaluation results on some benchmarks demonstrates our method can discover more unique paths than vanilla fuzz testing, and detect more bugs when compared with other off-the-shelf vulnerability discovery tools.

%\section{Length}\label{sec3}
%
%Original research papers submitted to the IET Research
%Journals should conform to the~IET Research Journals Length
%Policy [2]. The length guidelines include the
%abstract, references and appendices but do not include
%figure captions, equations, or table content.
%
%\section{Author names and affiliations}\label{sec4}
%
%Names and affiliations should immediately follow the title.
%To avoid confusion, the family name must be written as the
%last part of each author name and the first name should be
%spelt out rather than abbreviated (e.g. John A.K. Smith).
%Author details must not show any professional title (e.g.
%Managing Director), any academic title (e.g. Dr.) or any
%membership of any professional organisation.
%
%For multiple-authored articles, list the full names of all
%the authors, using identifiers to link an author with an
%affiliation where necessary (eg. John AK Smith$^{1}$,
%Edward Jones$^{2}$).
%
%The full affiliations of all authors should then be listed.
%Affiliations should include: the department name; the name
%of the university or company; the name of the city; and the
%name of the country (e.g. $^{1}$Department of Electrical
%Engineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia).
%
%If an author's present address is different from the
%address at which the work was carried out, this should be
%given as a secondary affiliation (see affiliation$^{4})$.
%
%Only the email address of the corresponding author is
%required and should be indicated with a *.
%
%All co-authors must be listed on ScholarOne Manuscript
%Central as part of the submission process. There is also
%the opportunity to include ORCID IDs for all authors in
%step 3 of the submission steps [3]. If you do not know
%a co-author's ORCID ID there is a look-up option included
%in Manuscript Central.
%
%\section{Page Formatting}\label{sec5}
%
%An easy way to comply with the requirements stated in the
%Author Guide [1] is to use this document as a template and
%simply type your text into it. PDF files are also accepted,
%so long as they follow the same style.
%
%\subsection{Page Layout}\label{subsec5.1}
%
%Our papers are double column format; one column width is
%8.6cm. All paragraphs must be justified, i.e. both
%left-justified and right-justified.
%
%\subsection{Text Font of Entire Document}\label{subsec5.2}
%
%
%It is recommended that standardised fonts such as Times New
%Roman and Arial are used with a font size no smaller than
%10pt.
%
%\subsection{Section Headings}\label{subsec5.3}
%
%All section heading should be numbered and no more than 3
%levels of headings should be used.
%
%\subsubsection{First Level Headings}\label{subsubsec5.3.1} The first level section headings
%should be in bold font (e.g. ``\textbf{1. Introduction}''),
%with the paragraph starting on a new line.
%
%%\begin{figure}[!t]
%%\centering{\includegraphics{sample_1.eps}}
%%\caption{Sample graph with blue (dotted), green (solid) and red (dashed) lines
%%\figfooter{a}{Subfigure 1}
%%\figfooter{b}{Subfigure 2}\label{fig1}}
%%\end{figure}
%%
%%\begin{figure*}[!b]
%%\centering{\includegraphics{sample_2.eps}}
%%\caption{Sample graph spaning two columns\label{fig2}}
%%\end{figure*}
%
%\subsubsection{Second Level Headings}\label{subsubsec5.3.2}
%
%The second level section headings should be in italic font
%(i.e. ``\textit{2.3 Section Headings}''. The paragraph
%should start on a new line.
%
%\subsubsection{Third Level Headings}\label{subsubsec5.3.3}
%
%The third level section headings should also be in italic
%font but should end with a colon (:). The text for that
%section should run on and not start as a new paragraph.
%
%
%\section{Figures}\label{sec6}
%
%Figures will be reproduced exactly as supplied, with no
%redrawing or relabelling. It is therefore imperative that
%the supplied figures are of the highest possible quality.
%The preferred format is encapsulated postscript (.eps) for
%line figures and .tif for halftone figures with a minimum
%resolution of 300\,dpi (dots per inch). With larger
%figures, please note that the editorial office may contact
%you to revise them to ensure they do not exceed half of a
%page, or so that they fill the entire page. This is because
%figures between these two lengths may negatively impact
%production later.
%
%Graphics may be full colour but please make sure that they
%are appropriate for print (black and white) and online
%(colour) publication. For example lines graphs should be
%colour and use dotted or dashed lines, or shapes to
%distinguish them apart in print (see Fig.~\ref{fig1}). Each
%figure should be explicitly referred to in numerical order.
%A maximum of four subfigures will be allowed per figure.
%
%Please note that IET typeset format is to float figures to
%the top or bottom of a page, they cannot appear within the
%main body,  interrupting the text.
%
%Figures can span two columns but cannot exceed 17.5\,cm in
%width (see Fig.~\ref{fig2}).
%
%%Figures and their subfigures should be treated as a static
%%image and should not fall onto other pages or columns.
%
%\begin{table}[!b]
%\processtable{Example table\label{tab1}}
%{\begin{tabular*}{20pc}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lll@{}}\toprule
%Column  &Column  & Column heading \\
%heading  &heading two &  three \\
%\midrule
%Row 1a  &Row 1b  &Row 1c \\
%Row 2a  &Row 2b  &Row 2c \\
%Row 3a  &Row 3b  & Row 3c \\

%Row 6a  & Row 6b  & Row 6c \\
%\botrule
%\end{tabular*}}{}
%\end{table}
%
%\subsection{Figure Captions}\label{subsec6.1}
%
%Figure captions must be below the figure, in 10\,pt italic
%font and should ideally consist of one sentence. If a
%figure has subfigures, all subfigures should also have a
%caption and should be identified by letters, e.g. $a$, $b$,
%$c$, as shown above.
%
%\section{Tables}\label{sec7}
%
%Tables should be formatted as shown in Table~\ref{tab1}
%with no column lines unless needed to clarify the content
%of the table. Row lines can be used to distinguish the
%column headings from the content of the table. Any tables
%larger than half a page should be placed in an appendix and
%the appendix cited within the main body of text eg. ``see
%Appendix 1 for table of results''.
%
%If the table has four or five columns it should span the
%whole width of the page. These should also float to the top
%or bottom of the page instead of breaking up the main text.
%
%\subsection{Table Captions}\label{subsec7.1}
%
%Tables must be numbered and cited within the text in strict
%numerical order. Table captions must be above the table and
%in 10\,pt font
%
%\section{Mathematics and equations}\label{sec8}
%
%When writing mathematics, avoid confusion between
%characters that could be mistaken for one another, e.g. the
%letter 'l' and the number one.
%
%\setcounter{equation}{2}
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\begin{equation}
%f(x)  = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty
%\left( {a_n \cos \frac{n\pi x}{L}+b_n \sin \frac{n\pi
%x}{L}} \right)+f(x) =a_0 +\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left({a_n \cos \frac{n\pi x}{L}+b_n
%\sin \frac{n\pi x}{L}} \right) \label{eq3}
%\end{equation}
%\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{.5pt}%\vskip3pt
%\end{figure*}
%
%\setcounter{equation}{0}
%
%Refer to equations using round brackets, e.g. (\ref{eq1})
%followed by (\ref{eq2}).
%\begin{align}
%A & = \pi r^2 \label{eq1}\\
%\cos \alpha +\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\cos \beta & =2\cos
%\frac{1}{2}\left( {\alpha +\beta } \right)\cos \frac{1}{2} \sum
%\left({\alpha \frac{dy}{dx}-\beta}\right)\label{eq2}
%\end{align}
%Equations should be capable of fitting into a two-column
%print format. If they do not fit into one column they
%should be floated to the bottom of the page or top of the
%next and cited in the text by "(see (3))". All large
%equations must be numbered in order to avoid confusion
%between floated equations and they cannot exceed a width of
%17.5cm.
%
%Vectors and matrices should be in bold italic and variables
%in italic.
%
%If your paper contains superscripts or subscripts, take
%special care to ensure that the positioning of the
%characters is unambiguous.
%
%Exponential expressions should be written using superscript
%notation, i.e. $5 \times 10^{3}$ not 5E03. A multiplication
%sign should be used, not a dot.
%
%Inline equations can be used but if the equation is longer
%than a line it will need to be broken up in a suitable
%location to ensure the line spacing is not too
%large $a^2+b^2=c^2$.
%
%\section{Page Numbers and Footers}\label{sec9}
%
%Page numbers should be used on all pages. Footers are not
%in IET's house style so must not be used. If they are used
%they will be moved to within the text at the typesetting
%stage.
%
%\section{Conclusion}\label{sec10}
%
%Submissions should always include the following sections:
%an abstract; an introduction; a conclusion and a references
%section. If any of the above sections are not included the
%paper will be unsubmitted and you will be asked to add the
%relevant section.
%
%\section{Acknowledgments}\label{sec11}
%
%Acknowledgements should be placed after the conclusion and before the
%references section. This is where reference to any grant numbers or
%supporting bodies should be included. The funding information should also be
%entered into the first submission step on Manuscript Central which collects
%Fundref information [4].
%
%Please note that the IET does not include author biographies in published
%papers.
%
%
%\section{References}\label{sec12}
%
%An average research paper should reference between 20 and 30 works, the bulk
%of which should be recently published (i.e. within the last five years)
%leading-edge articles in the field, preferably from top journals or
%conferences. You should compare your own findings to this recent research
%and demonstrate how your work improves on it in order to demonstrate that
%your work shows a significant advance over the state of the art -- a
%pre-requisite for publication in IET Research Journals.
%
%Please note that tables, figures and equations should not appear in the
%middle of the references. If this happens white space will be introduced to
%avoid items appearing in the references.
%
%\subsection{Referencing Style}\label{subsec12.1}
%
%You should number your references sequentially throughout the text, and each
%reference should be individually numbered and enclosed in square brackets
%(e.g. [1]).
%
%Please ensure that all references in the Reference list are cited in the
%text and vice versa. Failure to do so may cause delays in the production of
%your article.
%
%Please also ensure that you provide as much information as possible to allow
%the reader to locate the article concerned. This is particularly important
%for articles appearing in conferences, workshops and books that may not
%appear in journal databases.
%
%Do not include references for papers that have been submitted and not
%accepted for publication. Papers that have been accepted for publication are
%allowed as long as all information is provided.
%
%Please provide all author name(s) and initials, title of the paper, date
%published, title of the journal or book, volume number, editors (if any),
%and finally the page range. For books and conferences, the town of
%publication and publisher (in parentheses) should also be given.
%
%If the number of authors on a reference is greater than three please list
%the first three authors followed by \textit{et~al.} The reference list should be uninterrupted by figures, tables or equations.

%Nothing should interrupt the references.
