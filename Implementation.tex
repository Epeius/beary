Our prototype is built on top of AFL \cite{online:afl}, a popular 
state-of-the-art genetic fuzzing framework, and the S2E symbolic 
execution platform \cite{chipounov2011s2e}. S2E is a dynamic 
binary analysis platform which utilizes selective symbolic execution 
to analyze whole software stacks at runtime. S2E reuses parts of 
the QEMU virtual machine \cite{bellard2005qemu}, the KLEE symbolic 
execution engine \cite{cadar2008klee} and the LLVM 
toolchains \cite{lattner2004llvm}.

Our implementation consists of two main components, namely
\emph{Symbolic Path Finder (SPF)} and \emph{Seacher}. The \emph{SPF}
component is leveraged to help the fuzzer dive into deeper code areas
that are guarded by complex path constraints. Techniques to handle the
\textit{path explosion} problem raised by symbolic pointers and loops
are implemented inside of \emph{SPF}. The \emph{Searcher} is designed
to select the most promising seed file from the seed queue based on the
distance measurement. By doing this, the fuzzer will reach previously
untouched code areas as soon as possible in a given time budget.
