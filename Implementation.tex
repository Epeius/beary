Our prototype is built on top of AFL \cite{online:afl}, a popular state-of-the-art genetic fuzzing framework, and the S2E symbolic execution platform \cite{chipounov2011s2e}. S2E is a dynamic binary analysis platform which utilizes selective symbolic execution to analyze whole software stacks at runtime. S2E reuses parts of the QEMU virtual machine \cite{bellard2005qemu}, the KLEE symbolic execution engine \cite{cadar2008klee} and the LLVM toolchains \cite{lattner2004llvm}.

We made minor changes to AFL by implementing the distance based seed selection method. For S2E, we implemented three new plugins, namely \textit{BitmapSearcher}, \textit{LCSPhandler}, and \textit{SLBhandler}. The \textit{BitmapSearcher} is used to share internal information with AFL to generate test cases for the uncovered branches. The \textit{LCSPhandler} implements the LCSP algorithm to cover branches where state forking failures occur to improve the coverage. The \textit{SLBhandler} focuses on symbolic loops and leverages SLB method to only generate test cases for specific loop times according to the loop buckets.
