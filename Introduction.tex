Fuzz testing is a popular technique for automatic software vulnerability detection 
 \cite{Miller:Fuzz, 5010257, sutton2007fuzzing}.
 However, it suffers from the low efficiency bottleneck when being applied to real-world software 
 \cite{neystadt2008automated, godefroid2008automating, ganesh2009taint, cadar2011symbolic, rawat2017vuzzer, stephens2016driller},
  which often has complex input format, e.g., Portable Document Format (PDF).
  Most of the test cases generated by fuzz testing will be discarded on the shallow surface of such software.
  In order to improve the performance of traditional fuzz testing, 
  coverage-based fuzz testing collects all the test cases that contribute to the coverage into a seed file queue,
  and generates the test input from the seed files in each cycle of mutation using genetic methods
  \cite{rawat2017vuzzer, online:afl, stephens2016driller}.
  Although coverage-based fuzz testing is able to discover more paths than traditional fuzz testing, 
  due to the usage of random mutation,
  it is nevertheless incapable of triggering bugs that are deeply nested in complex code areas.

Dynamic symbolic execution is employed to improve the efficiency of fuzz testing in hybrid testing \cite{godefroid2012sage, yeh2015craxfuzz, majumdar2007hybrid, pak2012hybrid}.
 In such approach, corner cases that are difficult for fuzzers to cover are generated from dynamic symbolic execution by solving the corresponding path conditions.
 Meanwhile, dynamic symbolic execution can also benefit from the seed files in the queue from fuzzer 
 to quickly reach more wider code areas. 
 Driller, which is built on top of Angr symbolic execution engine \cite{Shoshitaishvili_firmalice-automatic} and AFL fuzzing engine \cite{online:afl}, 
 has attempted to leverage symbolic execution to solve the branches guarded 
 by complex path conditions to avoid the saturation of fuzzer \cite{stephens2016driller}. 
 And its performance in the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) from DARPA \cite{online:CGC} demonstrates the potential of this hybrid testing approach.


In hybrid testing, such as Driller, the performance gain from dynamic symbolic execution is still limited 
 by some certain program structures(e.g., symbolic pointers and loops) \cite{schwartz2010all, Boonstoppel:RAP, cadar2011symbolic, baldoni2016survey}. 
 Such structures will quickly generate many states that cannot trigger new behaviors,
 but raise the intrinsic \textit{state explosion} problem.
 Moreover, by leveraging dynamic symbolic execution, 
 the seed queue (including the initial seeds) of the fuzzer will quickly reach a large number for modern software. 
 So when given the testing time budget, the seed queue should be rearranged to make sure 
 that test case with greater probability of triggering new paths will be scheduled with high priority.

 In this paper, we propose two advanced techniques to improve the efficiency of dynamic symbolic execution assisted hybrid testing.
 
 On one hand, based on the lazy forking technique that employed in S2E\cite{chipounov2011s2e}, we concretize the symbolic pointers to avoid generating too many states but solve the pending states that forked from these pointers on demand to cover more branches; and an optimization based on the loop bucket mechanism of AFL \cite{online:afl} is introduced to avoid getting stuck in symbolic loops.
 On the other hand, to address the large size of seed queue, 
 we propose a distance based seed selection method for fuzz testing to improve the coverage when testing time is limited. 
 Each seed in the queue is equipped with an weight value.
 This value is obtained from the execution runtime information,
 which includes both path coverage and memory coverage.
 Our method prioritizes the seed queue according to this weight value and 
 then selects the seed file with the greatest weight value for next mutation cycle.


 Our main contributions consist of two main components, namely \emph{Symbolic Path Finder (SPF)} and \emph{Seacher}. 
 The \emph{SPF} component is leveraged to help the fuzzer to dive into deeper code areas 
 that are guarded by complex path constraints. 
 Techniques to handle the \textit{state explosion} problem 
 raised by symbolic pointers and loops are implemented inside of \emph{SPF}. 
 The \emph{Searcher} is designed to select the most promising seed file 
 from the seed queue based on the distance measurement. 
 By doing this, the fuzzer will touch more virgin code areas as soon as possible in a time budget. 

 Last but not least,  we have implemented the proposed techniques in a prototype tool,
 and performed comprehensive experimental evaluations on three different benchmarks. The benchmarks consist of a demo program which contains 9 different types of bugs, recently released LAVA benchmark \cite{dolan2016lava}, and a set of real world UNIX programs. The results show that our prototype can trigger more bugs than other state-of-the-art vulnerability detection tools. We also evaluated the path discovery ability of our prototype on a benchmark which contains several real-world UNIX programs, and the result shows that our approach can discover 43.49\% more unique paths in average than vanilla fuzz testing.

In summary, this paper makes the following contributions.
\begin{itemize}
\item We introduce a technique to avoid forking more states by postponing the concretization of symbolic pointer to the moment when branch condition depends on such pointer.  

\item We also present an optimization namely \emph{symbolic loop bucket} to ease the \textit{state explosion} problem by limiting the looping times to a serial of fixed buckets.

\item A \emph{distance based seed selection} method is proposed to select the most promising seed in the queue according to the runtime information to improve path coverage. 
\end{itemize}
