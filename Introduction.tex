Fuzz testing is a popular technique for automatic software vulnerability detection, 
however it suffers from the low efficiency bottleneck when being applied to real-world software. 
This is because modern software have complex input formats which determine that most of the test cases generated by fuzz testing will be discarded on the shallow surface of programs. 
Coverage based fuzz testing improves the performance of traditional fuzz testing by collecting all test cases that contribute to coverage into a seed file queue, and all the test cases in this queue will be picked up as the template file for a new cycle of mutation.
By utilizing such genetic method, the fuzzer can quickly touch more new paths and find more bugs than traditional fuzz testing. However, treating the software as a gray box determines it still cannot trigger the bugs that deeply nested in complex code areas.  

Hybrid testing method improves the efficiency of fuzzing testing by employing the advantages of symbolic execution.  
This is because symbolic execution can easily cover the corner cases that are difficult for fuzzer to cover. Meanwhile, symbolic execution can also benefit from the seed files in the queue from fuzzer to quickly reach more wider code areas. 
Driller, which is built on top of Angr symbolic execution engine and AFL fuzzing engine, has attempted to leverage symbolic execution to solve the branches guarded by complex path conditions to avoid the saturation of fuzzer \cite{stephens2016driller}. And its performance in the CGC challenge \cite{online:CGC} demonstrates the potential of this hybrid testing approach.

However, the performance gain from symbolic execution in hybrid testing is still deeply affected by some program structures(e.g., symbolic pointers and loops). Such structures will quickly generate many states that cannot trigger new behaviors but raise the intrinsic \textit{path explosion} problem of symbolic execution.
Meanwhile, by leveraging symbolic execution, the seed queue (including the initial seeds) of the fuzzer will quickly reach a large number for modern software. So when given the testing time budget, the seed queue should be rearranged to make sure the test case that has greater probability to trigger new paths will be tested with high priority.  

In this paper, we introduced two improvements to ease the \textit{path explosion} problem raised from the symbolic pointers and loops when using symbolic execution to assist coverage based fuzz testing. 
Symbolic pointers are lazily concretized to cover more branches and limit the number of states. 
Based on the loop bucket mechanism of AFL, we introduced an optimization to avoid generating too many states when handing symbolic loops. 
To address the large size of seed queue, we proposed a distance based seed prioritization method for fuzz testing to speed up the path discovery. 
Each test case in seed queue is enhanced with an weight value which is obtained from the execution runtime information which includes path coverage and memory coverage.
Our method prioritizes the seed queue according to this weight value and then selects the seed file with the greatest weight value for next mutation cycle.
And we also designed and implemented the prototype which is built on top of our method. Figure~\ref{Framework} shows the high level framework of our prototype.
Our main contributions consists of two main components, namely \emph{Concolic Path Finder} and \emph{Seacher}. The \emph{Concolic Path Finder} is leveraged to help the fuzzer to dive into deeper code areas that guarded by complex path constraints. Easing the \textit{path explosion} problem raised by symbolic pointers and loops is implemented inside of \emph{Concolic Path Finder}. The \emph{Searcher} is designed to select the most promising seed file from the seed queue based on the distance measurement. By doing this, the fuzzer will touch more virgin code areas as soon as possible in a time budget. 
Furthermore, some additional evaluations on different benchmarks are performed to demonstrate the ability of our methods.

In summary, this paper makes the following contributions.
\begin{itemize}
\item A novel \emph{lazily concretization} method for symbolic pointers is proposed to cover new branches by avoid generating more states, we also present an optimization namely \emph{symbolic loop bucket} for symbolic loops to ease the \emph{path explosion} problem when using symbolic execution to assist fuzz testing.

\item A \emph{distance based seed prioritization} method is proposed to select the most promising seed in the queue to improve path discovery when testing time is limited. 

\item We implemented the prototype based on our method, and the evaluation results on several benchmarks demonstrate the ability of our method for different viewpoints.
